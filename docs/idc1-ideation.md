# IDC 1 - Ideation

1. My dog likes when my balcony door is open so he can have some fresh air, but in the winter it's too cold to keep it open for him. This results in him constantly pawing at the door so I open it, only for him to stay inside.
2. The pet camera I got requires you to pay a subscription, but half the time doesn't even work.
3. I feel bad leaving my dog home while I'm away. I've tried puzzle toys, but they are a short lived distraction. It would be cool to have a toy that I could "reset" remotely. He's very food motivated and can be a bit destructive in the pursuit of said food.
4. I have a nice camera, but it's a bit bulky so I barely ever take it places. I like disposable cameras, but they are expensive and feel wasteful. It would be nice to have a "digital disposable" camera. Depending on the approach, might be more of a CAD project than an arduino one.
5. I'm annoyed that my project from last semester isn't as cool as I was hoping.
